=============

2011 node 0.4 book demo, from David Herron's book "Node Web Development" published by Packt. 
Since 2011, everything broke! It's been extensively refracktored/rehacktored to work in the 2014 version of node 0.8

Express was a lot different back then.
Then getting to heroku brought fun! There was a db abstraction layer he made up that had to be tenderized and mangled up
for heroku 3rd party mongobility.

Still a bit worse for the wear, as the home page lacks the "Add" link as of July 21, 2014
but you can append the "add" url to the site in the browser and a minimal add form will appear.

It works today.
